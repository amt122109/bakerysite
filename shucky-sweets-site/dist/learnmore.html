											<h2>Hello!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Welcome, to the amazingly sweet world of Shucky's Sweets! I am a cottage style bakery with everything
                                            made from my home. I take great pride in every single item that comes out of my kitchen and I want 
                                            you to love your sweet treat just as much as I do! I am located in Liberty Township, Oh and since this is my home, I do not have a true storefront.
                                            All items are completely customized and scheduled for pickup on a designated date and timeframe.</p>

									<h3><u>General Information and Policies</u></h3>
<br> <li>All cakes are frosted with my homemade American buttercream or cream cheese buttercream. Other premium buttercreams can be used to cover cakes as requested but, additional fees would apply.</li>
<li>Starting prices are based on a 3-layer cake with buttercream in between layers. (sheetcakes and 4in cakes are only two layers, as well as some sculpted/theme cakes.)</li>									
                                <li>Cake fillings-other than traditional buttercream are at an additional fee. (See pricing lists.)</li>
                                <li>I will <strong>NOT</strong> wrap my cakes in fondant. Fondant is only used as a decorating tool to enhance the cake's design as needed.</li>
                                <li>Pricing quoted on the pricing list is for basic cake decorating, additional fees may apply for various designs/themes/scuplted cakes. A two week advance notice is highly suggested and availabilty may vary based upon season and schedule. </li>
                                <li>Please keep in mind tiered cakes can be heavy and if you opt to pickup, transportation can be challenging.</li>
                                <li>Chilling/refrigeration cakes prior to event is highly reccommended since it is true Buttercream and can melt, even if left out in room temperature. Also, avoid placing the items near sunny places or leaving them in your vehicle for too long.</li>
		<br>
<h3><u>Additional information:</u></h3>
<b>ALLERGY NOTICE: I will do my best to accommodate allergy sensitivities, but please keep in mind this is my own PERSONAL kitchen. I cannot guarantee items will not be cross-contaminated. My kitchen processes all of the major known food contaminants such as; Tree Nuts, Strawberries, Peanuts, Soy, Eggs, Gluten, Etc.</b><br>
		<li>Vegan cakes- All vegan cakes are made using the same equiptment as other cakes but, special care is noted for making sure the equiptment
			has been cleaned properly before baking, assembling and decorating. Vegan Buttercream is used for the base of the cake and can be colored and decorated as a traditional cake. 
			All Fruit fillings are vegan friendly as well as, a vegan peanut butter filling. Current vegan cake flavors include the following:
			Vanilla, Almond, Chocolate and Carrot. Additional flavors may be availabile upon request. </li>
		<li>Gluten-Free Cakes: We offer this option as well, please see our Flavors-List page. </li>
